# customurl2steamid64
VERY simple NodeJS module to get a user's steamID64 based on customURL. No API key needed.

### What's this for?
This module will allow you to get the SteamID64 for any Steam player, as long as the target profile is public.

### But why?
I couldn't find this utility for a project I'm working on, so I decided to write it myself and learn some NodeJS in the process.

### Is this oficially supported?
Not by Valve Software by any means. I'm just a fan. I'll try to support development of this library for as long as I can

### Cloning
    $ git clone https://github.com/yllanos/customurl2steamid64.git

### Installing
    $ npm install

### Testing
    $ node test.js

(You should get this number on your console:)
    76561198008252756

You could also alter [this file](../blob/master/test.js) on variable 'username' to whatever Steam user you wish to test

### Example
