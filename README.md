# customurl2steamid64
VERY simple NodeJS module to get a user's steamID64 based on customURL. No API key needed.

### What's this for?
This module will allow you to get the SteamID64 for any Steam player, as long as the target profile is public. 

### But why?
I couldn't find this utility for a project I'm working on, so I decided to write it myself and learn some NodeJS in the process.

### Is this oficially supported?
Not by Valve Software by any means. I'm just a fan. I'll try to support development of this library for as long as I can

### Cloning
